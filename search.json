Propal height and propal \nwidth increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. \nSexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but \nthere was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack \nof difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is \nno character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference \nfor the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely \ndue to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \nindividual crabs.  \n \nIntroduction: \n \nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \nnudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \nfiner sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \nconsiderable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \nCharifson 3 \n \nroughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \nmay differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \nBoth species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \nthreat to littorines.  \n \nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \nCharifson 4 \n \nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \n \nStudy System: \n \nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.  Two shore crabs (clade: \nBrachyura: Family Grapsidae), Hemigrapsus oregonensis  and Hemigrapsus nudus were \ncollected in the intertidal adjacent to the Friday Harbor Laboratories dock. These closely related \ncrabs are morphologically similar, but can be distinguished by the presence of purple spots on \nthe cheliped of H. nudus and abundant setae on the pereopods of H. oregonensis (Kozloff 1987). \nLacuna vincta, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were collected at False Bay and \nDead Man Cove. Littorina scutulata, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were \ncollected from the rocky intertidal zone of Fourth of July Beach.  \n \nMaterials and Methods: \nMorphometrics \n \nMale and females of H. oregonensis and H. nudus were measured with digital calipers \n(0.1 mm). Each crab was measured for carapace width, propal height and propal width. Carapace \nwidth was taken at the widest part of the carapace. Propal height was measured at the highest \nvertical distance along the propus. Propal width was measured perpendicular to propal height, \nfrom the left to right sides of the propus. All claw measurements were made on the left cheliped. \nCharifson 5 \n \nIf there was a size disparity between the left and right claws due to regeneration of a lost claw, \nthe crab was excluded from the study. Ratios of carapace width:propal height (CW:PH) and \ncarapace width:propal width (CW:PW) were calculated.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference \n \nThree female (Fe1, Fe2, Fe3) and three male (Ma1, Ma2, Ma3) crabs of H. nudus with \npropal heights between 5-6 mm were placed in small flow-through containers. Five L. scutulata \nand five L. vincta with shell lengths between 4-6 mm were added to each container. The ranges \nof crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the \ncrabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the \nrange of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and \nL. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nThe crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. \nAfter 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption \nrate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \n \nFor the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and \nspecies. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab \nmorphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol \nand Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA \nCharifson 6 \n \nwith factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each \nindividual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail \nconsumption rates by H. nudus.  \n \nResults: \nMorphometrics: \n \nCarapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and \npropal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus. There was \nless variation in the relationship between carapace width and propal height than with propal \nwidth.  Due to non-normality of CW:PH and CW:PW an arcsin transformation was used. A \nsignificant effect for sex was found for both CW:PH (F1, 45 = 125.6, p &lt; 0.001) and CW:PW  (F1, \n45 = 103.81, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between Hemigrapsus species for \nCW:PH (F1, 45 &lt; 0.01, p = 0.983) and CW:PW (F1, 45 = 0.09, p = 0.764). A significant \nsex*species interaction was detected for both CW:PH (F1, 45 4.39, p = 0.042) and CW:PW (F1, 45 \n= 7.19, p = 0.010). Figure 3 and 4 show the means of CW:PH and CW:PW in by sex and species \nrespectively.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference:  \n \nExpected values for both the number of L. scutulata and L. vincta consumed for the G-\ntest are 0.5 multiplied by the total number of snails consumed by each individual crab. G-tests \nfor individual H. nudus that eat snails were all significant at p &lt; 0.001 with 1 degree of freedom \n(See Table 2 for statistical summary). The three crabs that did not eat either L. scutulata or L. \nvincta could not be tested for feeding preference.  \nCharifson 7 \n \n \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nNo significant difference in crab feeding rate (snails consumed/hour) was found (F2, 21 = \n2.52, p = 0.104) among individual H. nudus that fed on snails during the course of the \nconsumption experiment (Figure 5). Fe2  ate snails at a rate of 0.59±0.53 snails/hour (variance is \nstandard deviation), Ma1 feeding rate was 0.24±0.31 snails/hour, and Ma2 had a feeding rate of \n0.80±0.38 snails/hour. Individuals Fe1, Fe3 and Ma3 did not consume any snails during the \ncourse of the experiment.  \n \nDiscussion: \n \nA few interesting patterns emerged in the morphometric analysis of Hemigrapsus nudus \nand Hemigrapsus orogenensis. The variance in propal height or propal width explained by \ncarapace width was surprisingly high in female H. nudus with R2 values of 0.976 found for \npropal height and 0.927 for propal width. Male H. oregenensis had the greatest variation in chela \nsize parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width \nrespectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently \nlower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In \ngeneral the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \nvalues) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \nmore variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \nefficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \nwhich exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \ncompetition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). \nCharifson 8 \n \nThis is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \nHemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  \nSexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \nHemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \nThe two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \nsuggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \nfunctionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \ndifference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \ndisplacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \ndisplacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \nTo make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \nsympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \n2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \nsympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \nspecies sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \nthe two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \nthe same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \nintertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide \nenough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry. Desiccation tolerance may be \na better trait to test for character displacement in these shore crabs.  \nH. nudus males and females clearly preferred to eat the thinner shelled Lacuna vincta \n(Table 2). During the course of the feeding preference experiment all the crabs that ate snails \nconsumed L. vincta exclusively. However, one Littorina scutuala was eaten by H. nudus when \nCharifson 9 \n \ndetermining consumption rates. The six crabs were chosen because their claws were of \nappropriate size to eat littorines with shell length between 4-6 mm, yet only half of the crabs ate \nthese snails. This could be due to insufficient time to acclimate H. nudus to lab conditions and \npossibly reduced feeding associated with molting. Male snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, were \nshown to cease feeding 3-6 weeks before and 3-4 weeks after molting (O’Halloran and O’Dor \n1988).  \nIt was my original intention to test for sex differences in consumption rates, but this was \nnot possible as I could not collect many crabs of the appropriate claw size for gastropod feeding \nand many of the crabs I did collect did not feed. There were no statistically significant \ndifferences in consumption rates (snails eaten/hour) among the three feeding H. nudus. These \nindividuals had highly variable feeding rates, mostly due to trials in which the crab did not feed. \nSylvia Behrens Yamada and Elizabeth Boulding (1998) found that H. nudus consumed 1.8 \nLittorina. sitkana/individual crab/day. In my study crabs fed on 13.03 Lacuna vincta/individual \ncrab/ day. The greater consumption rate in my study is likely due to the easily breakable shells of \nLa. vincta.  \nThe findings of this study suggest that there is no potential for character displacement of \nchela size in the sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis. This leaves the question of species co-\noccurrence open to other possibilities. H. nudus has a strong preference for La. vincta, but it \nseems as if there have been no studies that show predation on La. vincta in the field. It should be \nnoted that H. nudus and La. vincta usually occupy different portions of the intertidal and may \nhave little contact with each other, unlike the relationship between H. nudus and Li. scutulata. \nThere is some potential for overlap in the winter when La. vincta migrates up shore. Although no \ndifferences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus were found, this might be \nCharifson 10 \n \ndue to logistical issues surrounding the experimental design and little replication. Future studies \nshould include more crabs, the exclusion of non-feeding crabs, and trial periods with longer time \nintervals. Additionally, any subsequent study should utilize multivariate and geometric \nmorphometric methods to quantify claw shape instead of using ratios, as two similar ratios may \nhave different shape.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nI would like to thank Dianna Padilla, Michael LaBarbera, and Kevin Turner for advice \nrelating to the experimental design of this study.

It will probably be more accurate for the OpenAI models.\n\nHow the text is split: by character passed in\nHow the chunk size is measured: by tiktoken tokenizer\n\nModels don’t see text like humans, instead they see a sequence of numbers (known as tokens). Byte pair encoding (BPE) is a way of converting text into tokens. It has a couple desirable properties:\n\nIt’s reversible and lossless, so you can convert tokens back into the original text\nIt works on arbitrary text, even text that is not in the tokeniser’s training data\nIt compresses the text: the token sequence is shorter than the bytes corresponding to the original text. On average, in practice, each token corresponds to about 4 bytes.\nIt attempts to let the model see common subwords. For instance, “ing” is a common subword in English, so BPE encodings will often split “encoding” into tokens like “encod” and “ing” (instead of e.g. “enc” and “oding”). Because the model will then see the “ing” token again and again in different contexts, it helps models generalise and better understand grammar.\n\nAttributeError: ‘str’ object has no attribute ’page_content\ndocs2 = tk_text_splitter.split_text(text_file) –&gt; tk_text_splitter.create_documents(text_file)\n\n#load a tiktoken splitter directly\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import TokenTextSplitter\n\ntk_text_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size = 200, chunk_overlap = 0)\n\ndocs2 = tk_text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n\nprint(docs2[0])\n\npage_content='Charifson 1 \\n \\nSnail Predation by Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis: Sex and Species \\nDifferences in Chela Size. \\n \\nDavid Charifson1,2 \\n \\nMarine Invertebrate Zoology \\nSummer 2014 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 \\n2 Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5245 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContact information: \\nDavid Charifson \\nDepartment of Ecology and Evolution \\nStony Brook University \\n650 Life Sciences Building \\nStony Brook, NY 11794-5245 \\nDavid.charifson@stonybrook.edu  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nKeywords: Hemig' metadata={'source': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf', 'file_path': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'David', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007', 'creationDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}\n\n\n\n#Initialize Embeddings\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()",

    "text": "Text Splitters\nThe concept of text splitters revolves around the need to break down long pieces of text into smaller, meaningful chunks.\nThe goal is to split the text in a way that keeps semantically related pieces together, with th definition of “semantically related depending on the specific type of text being processed.\nLanguage models have a token limit. You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model.\nText splitter allow customization:\n\nChunk_size parameter determines the number of text inputs that will be grouped together as a single request or chunk. This parameter allows you to control the granularity of the chnks and how much text is processed together at once.\nChunk_overlap parameter refers to the maximum overlap between consecutive chunks. By overlap inclusion, the TextSplitter ensures that is a continuity and context maintained between the chunks i.e. preserves the flow of information and avoids abrupt transitions between chunks.\n\n\nSentenceTransformers\nThe SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter is a specialized text splitter for use with the sentence-transformer models. The default behaviour is to split the text into chunks that fit the token window of the sentence transformer model that you would like to use.\n\ntext_splitter = SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000,chunk_overlap=20, length_function = len)\n\n\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n\n\nlen(docs)\n\n28\n\n\n\ndocs[0].metadata\n\n{'source': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf',\n 'file_path': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf',\n 'page': 0,\n 'total_pages': 19,\n 'format': 'PDF 1.5',\n 'title': '',\n 'author': 'David',\n 'subject': '',\n 'keywords': '',\n 'creator': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007',\n 'producer': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007',\n 'creationDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\",\n 'modDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\",\n 'trapped': ''}",

This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.\nSentenceTransformers embeddings are called using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings integration.

    "text": "Map Refine Document Chain\nThe refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer.\nSince the Refine chain only passes a single document to the LLM at a time, it is well-suited for tasks that require analyzing more documents than can fit in the model’s context. The obvious tradeoff is that this chain will make far more LLM calls than, for example, the Stuff documents chain. There are also certain tasks which are difficult to accomplish iteratively. For example, the Refine chain can perform poorly when documents frequently cross-reference one another or when a task requires detailed information from many documents.\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI()\n\n\nqa_refine = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm =llm, chain_type = \"refine\", \n                                        retriever = vs2.as_retriever(),\n                                       return_source_documents = True\n                                       )\n\n\nquery = \"what is this paper about?\"\n\n#This format when we include return_source_documents\nresult = qa_refine({\"query\": query})\n\nWARNING:langchain.llms.base:Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.&lt;locals&gt;._completion_with_retry in 4.0 seconds as it raised Timeout: Request timed out: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.openai.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The study includes data from eight trials, involving three female crabs (fe1 to fe3) and three male crabs (ma1 to ma3). The paper investigates whether there are differences in consumption rates among individuals that consumed snails and those that did not.

    "text": "Getting to know LLMs and LangChain\nA foundational element of using LangChain as a wrapper for large language models (LLMs) like GPT4 is the prompt. A prompt in the LLM context is just like a prompt in the usual context: it’s a thoughtfully designed question meant to elicit a response. If you want to use an LLM to explore text, it is critically important to design an effective prompt that will help the model generate accurate and helpful responses. We are exploring the use of LLMs to help us “read” undergraduate student research papers in marine science and figure out if the paper contains a species occurrence. That is, did the student observe or collect a given species at a given place during the course of their research? If they did, that kind of information is a species occurrence (species + place + date).\nTo explore the potential for using LLMs in this work, we selected a few online tools that are designed to help the user ask questions about text provided to the application. We picked a few student papers at random (all open access) and iterated on a series of questions to learn how to engineer prompts that might give us the information we need to determine if a paper includes a species occurrence. This was our process and what we found.",

Propal height and propal \nwidth increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. \nSexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but \nthere was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack \nof difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is \nno character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference \nfor the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely \ndue to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \nindividual crabs.  \n \nIntroduction: \n \nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \nnudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \nfiner sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \nconsiderable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \nCharifson 3 \n \nroughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \nmay differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \nBoth species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \nthreat to littorines.  \n \nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \nCharifson 4 \n \nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \n \nStudy System: \n \nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.  Two shore crabs (clade: \nBrachyura: Family Grapsidae), Hemigrapsus oregonensis  and Hemigrapsus nudus were \ncollected in the intertidal adjacent to the Friday Harbor Laboratories dock. These closely related \ncrabs are morphologically similar, but can be distinguished by the presence of purple spots on \nthe cheliped of H. nudus and abundant setae on the pereopods of H. oregonensis (Kozloff 1987). \nLacuna vincta, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were collected at False Bay and \nDead Man Cove. Littorina scutulata, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were \ncollected from the rocky intertidal zone of Fourth of July Beach.  \n \nMaterials and Methods: \nMorphometrics \n \nMale and females of H. oregonensis and H. nudus were measured with digital calipers \n(0.1 mm). Each crab was measured for carapace width, propal height and propal width. Carapace \nwidth was taken at the widest part of the carapace. Propal height was measured at the highest \nvertical distance along the propus. Propal width was measured perpendicular to propal height, \nfrom the left to right sides of the propus. All claw measurements were made on the left cheliped. \nCharifson 5 \n \nIf there was a size disparity between the left and right claws due to regeneration of a lost claw, \nthe crab was excluded from the study. Ratios of carapace width:propal height (CW:PH) and \ncarapace width:propal width (CW:PW) were calculated.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference \n \nThree female (Fe1, Fe2, Fe3) and three male (Ma1, Ma2, Ma3) crabs of H. nudus with \npropal heights between 5-6 mm were placed in small flow-through containers. Five L. scutulata \nand five L. vincta with shell lengths between 4-6 mm were added to each container. The ranges \nof crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the \ncrabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the \nrange of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and \nL. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nThe crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. \nAfter 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption \nrate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \n \nFor the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and \nspecies. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab \nmorphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol \nand Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA \nCharifson 6 \n \nwith factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each \nindividual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail \nconsumption rates by H. nudus.  \n \nResults: \nMorphometrics: \n \nCarapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and \npropal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus. There was \nless variation in the relationship between carapace width and propal height than with propal \nwidth.  Due to non-normality of CW:PH and CW:PW an arcsin transformation was used. A \nsignificant effect for sex was found for both CW:PH (F1, 45 = 125.6, p &lt; 0.001) and CW:PW  (F1, \n45 = 103.81, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between Hemigrapsus species for \nCW:PH (F1, 45 &lt; 0.01, p = 0.983) and CW:PW (F1, 45 = 0.09, p = 0.764). A significant \nsex*species interaction was detected for both CW:PH (F1, 45 4.39, p = 0.042) and CW:PW (F1, 45 \n= 7.19, p = 0.010). Figure 3 and 4 show the means of CW:PH and CW:PW in by sex and species \nrespectively.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference:  \n \nExpected values for both the number of L. scutulata and L. vincta consumed for the G-\ntest are 0.5 multiplied by the total number of snails consumed by each individual crab. G-tests \nfor individual H. nudus that eat snails were all significant at p &lt; 0.001 with 1 degree of freedom \n(See Table 2 for statistical summary). The three crabs that did not eat either L. scutulata or L. \nvincta could not be tested for feeding preference.  \nCharifson 7 \n \n \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nNo significant difference in crab feeding rate (snails consumed/hour) was found (F2, 21 = \n2.52, p = 0.104) among individual H. nudus that fed on snails during the course of the \nconsumption experiment (Figure 5). Fe2  ate snails at a rate of 0.59±0.53 snails/hour (variance is \nstandard deviation), Ma1 feeding rate was 0.24±0.31 snails/hour, and Ma2 had a feeding rate of \n0.80±0.38 snails/hour. Individuals Fe1, Fe3 and Ma3 did not consume any snails during the \ncourse of the experiment.  \n \nDiscussion: \n \nA few interesting patterns emerged in the morphometric analysis of Hemigrapsus nudus \nand Hemigrapsus orogenensis. The variance in propal height or propal width explained by \ncarapace width was surprisingly high in female H. nudus with R2 values of 0.976 found for \npropal height and 0.927 for propal width. Male H. oregenensis had the greatest variation in chela \nsize parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width \nrespectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently \nlower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In \ngeneral the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \nvalues) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \nmore variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \nefficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \nwhich exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \ncompetition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). \nCharifson 8 \n \nThis is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \nHemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  \nSexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \nHemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \nThe two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \nsuggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \nfunctionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \ndifference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \ndisplacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \ndisplacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \nTo make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \nsympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \n2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \nsympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \nspecies sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \nthe two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \nthe same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \nintertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide \nenough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry. Desiccation tolerance may be \na better trait to test for character displacement in these shore crabs.  \nH. nudus males and females clearly preferred to eat the thinner shelled Lacuna vincta \n(Table 2). During the course of the feeding preference experiment all the crabs that ate snails \nconsumed L. vincta exclusively. However, one Littorina scutuala was eaten by H. nudus when \nCharifson 9 \n \ndetermining consumption rates. The six crabs were chosen because their claws were of \nappropriate size to eat littorines with shell length between 4-6 mm, yet only half of the crabs ate \nthese snails. This could be due to insufficient time to acclimate H. nudus to lab conditions and \npossibly reduced feeding associated with molting. Male snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, were \nshown to cease feeding 3-6 weeks before and 3-4 weeks after molting (O’Halloran and O’Dor \n1988).  \nIt was my original intention to test for sex differences in consumption rates, but this was \nnot possible as I could not collect many crabs of the appropriate claw size for gastropod feeding \nand many of the crabs I did collect did not feed. There were no statistically significant \ndifferences in consumption rates (snails eaten/hour) among the three feeding H. nudus. These \nindividuals had highly variable feeding rates, mostly due to trials in which the crab did not feed. \nSylvia Behrens Yamada and Elizabeth Boulding (1998) found that H. nudus consumed 1.8 \nLittorina. sitkana/individual crab/day. In my study crabs fed on 13.03 Lacuna vincta/individual \ncrab/ day. The greater consumption rate in my study is likely due to the easily breakable shells of \nLa. vincta.  \nThe findings of this study suggest that there is no potential for character displacement of \nchela size in the sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis. This leaves the question of species co-\noccurrence open to other possibilities. H. nudus has a strong preference for La. vincta, but it \nseems as if there have been no studies that show predation on La. vincta in the field. It should be \nnoted that H. nudus and La. vincta usually occupy different portions of the intertidal and may \nhave little contact with each other, unlike the relationship between H. nudus and Li. scutulata. \nThere is some potential for overlap in the winter when La. vincta migrates up shore. Although no \ndifferences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus were found, this might be \nCharifson 10 \n \ndue to logistical issues surrounding the experimental design and little replication. Future studies \nshould include more crabs, the exclusion of non-feeding crabs, and trial periods with longer time \nintervals. Additionally, any subsequent study should utilize multivariate and geometric \nmorphometric methods to quantify claw shape instead of using ratios, as two similar ratios may \nhave different shape.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nI would like to thank Dianna Padilla, Michael LaBarbera, and Kevin Turner for advice \nrelating to the experimental design of this study.

We each hold large collections of student research reports that contain observations of environmental conditions, species, and populations recorded over a span of at least nine decades. As we seek funding to support the digitization and preservation of collections from partner institutions, the Taxa Project explores the potential of computational methods to amplify the work of librarians in identifying and verifying species observations in student papers from Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University (HMS).

The DPG is staffed by highly skilled professional imaging specialists and student assistants, and they have well-established workflows for capturing and processing digital content, and accessioning it into the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR). Their scanning process generated, for each page, a high-resolution JPEG 2000 for preservation, a medium resolution jpg for the catalog media viewer interface, an ALTO XML file, and a text-searchable PDF of the full paper. These files are all stored in Stanford Digital Repository (SDR) for preservation and access purposes.\nFor this phase of the project we will be working with the PDFs, but we plan to incorporate an open software image OCR step into our workflow so it will be more directly portable to our community of practice.\n\n💡 The following DPG staff contributed to the digitization and accessioning of the Hopkins Marine Station student papers: Katharine Dimitruk, Alexander Nguyen, Laura Nguyen, Linda Lam (supervisor).",

    "text": "Text Splitters\nThe concept of text splitters revolves around the need to break down long pieces of text into smaller, meaningful chunks.\nThe goal is to split the text in a way that keeps semantically related pieces together, with th definition of “semantically related depending on the specific type of text being processed.\nLanguage models have a token limit. You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model.\nText splitter allow customization:\n\nChunk_size parameter determines the number of text inputs that will be grouped together as a single request or chunk. This parameter allows you to control the granularity of the chnks and how much text is processed together at once.\nChunk_overlap parameter refers to the maximum overlap between consecutive chunks. By overlap inclusion, the TextSplitter ensures that is a continuity and context maintained between the chunks i.e. preserves the flow of information and avoids abrupt transitions between chunks.\n\n\nSentenceTransformers\nThe SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter is a specialized text splitter for use with the sentence-transformer models. The default behaviour is to split the text into chunks that fit the token window of the sentence transformer model that you would like to use.\n\ntext_splitter = SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000,chunk_overlap=20, length_function = len)\n\n\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n\n\nlen(docs)\n\n28\n\n\n\ndocs[0].metadata\n\n{'source': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf',\n 'file_path': 'hms/fhl_2014_Charifson_34622 (1).pdf',\n 'page': 0,\n 'total_pages': 19,\n 'format': 'PDF 1.5',\n 'title': '',\n 'author': 'David',\n 'subject': '',\n 'keywords': '',\n 'creator': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007',\n 'producer': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007',\n 'creationDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\",\n 'modDate': \"D:20140723120649-04'00'\",\n 'trapped': ''}"

    "text": "Text embedding\nEmbeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.\nSentenceTransformers embeddings are called using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings integration.

For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer.\nSince the Refine chain only passes a single document to the LLM at a time, it is well-suited for tasks that require analyzing more documents than can fit in the model’s context. The obvious tradeoff is that this chain will make far more LLM calls than, for example, the Stuff documents chain. There are also certain tasks which are difficult to accomplish iteratively. For example, the Refine chain can perform poorly when documents frequently cross-reference one another or when a task requires detailed information from many documents.\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI()\n\n\nqa_refine = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm =llm, chain_type = \"refine\", \n                                        retriever = vs2.as_retriever(),\n                                       return_source_documents = True\n                                       )\n\n\nquery = \"what is this paper about?\"\n\n#This format when we include return_source_documents\nresult = qa_refine({\"query\": query})\n\nWARNING:langchain.llms.base:Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.&lt;locals&gt;._completion_with_retry in 4.0 seconds as it raised Timeout: Request timed out: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.openai.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Propal height and propal \nwidth increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. \nSexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but \nthere was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack \nof difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is \nno character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference \nfor the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely \ndue to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \nindividual crabs.  \n \nIntroduction: \n \nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \nnudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \nfiner sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \nconsiderable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \nCharifson 3 \n \nroughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \nmay differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \nBoth species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \nthreat to littorines.  \n \nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \nCharifson 4 \n \nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \n \nStudy System: \n \nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.  Two shore crabs (clade: \nBrachyura: Family Grapsidae), Hemigrapsus oregonensis  and Hemigrapsus nudus were \ncollected in the intertidal adjacent to the Friday Harbor Laboratories dock. These closely related \ncrabs are morphologically similar, but can be distinguished by the presence of purple spots on \nthe cheliped of H. nudus and abundant setae on the pereopods of H. oregonensis (Kozloff 1987). \nLacuna vincta, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were collected at False Bay and \nDead Man Cove. Littorina scutulata, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were \ncollected from the rocky intertidal zone of Fourth of July Beach.  \n \nMaterials and Methods: \nMorphometrics \n \nMale and females of H. oregonensis and H. nudus were measured with digital calipers \n(0.1 mm). Each crab was measured for carapace width, propal height and propal width. Carapace \nwidth was taken at the widest part of the carapace. Propal height was measured at the highest \nvertical distance along the propus. Propal width was measured perpendicular to propal height, \nfrom the left to right sides of the propus. All claw measurements were made on the left cheliped. \nCharifson 5 \n \nIf there was a size disparity between the left and right claws due to regeneration of a lost claw, \nthe crab was excluded from the study. Ratios of carapace width:propal height (CW:PH) and \ncarapace width:propal width (CW:PW) were calculated.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference \n \nThree female (Fe1, Fe2, Fe3) and three male (Ma1, Ma2, Ma3) crabs of H. nudus with \npropal heights between 5-6 mm were placed in small flow-through containers. Five L. scutulata \nand five L. vincta with shell lengths between 4-6 mm were added to each container. The ranges \nof crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the \ncrabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the \nrange of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and \nL. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nThe crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. \nAfter 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption \nrate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \n \nFor the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and \nspecies. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab \nmorphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol \nand Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA \nCharifson 6 \n \nwith factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each \nindividual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail \nconsumption rates by H. nudus.  \n \nResults: \nMorphometrics: \n \nCarapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and \npropal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus. There was \nless variation in the relationship between carapace width and propal height than with propal \nwidth.  Due to non-normality of CW:PH and CW:PW an arcsin transformation was used. A \nsignificant effect for sex was found for both CW:PH (F1, 45 = 125.6, p &lt; 0.001) and CW:PW  (F1, \n45 = 103.81, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between Hemigrapsus species for \nCW:PH (F1, 45 &lt; 0.01, p = 0.983) and CW:PW (F1, 45 = 0.09, p = 0.764). A significant \nsex*species interaction was detected for both CW:PH (F1, 45 4.39, p = 0.042) and CW:PW (F1, 45 \n= 7.19, p = 0.010). Figure 3 and 4 show the means of CW:PH and CW:PW in by sex and species \nrespectively.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference:  \n \nExpected values for both the number of L. scutulata and L. vincta consumed for the G-\ntest are 0.5 multiplied by the total number of snails consumed by each individual crab. G-tests \nfor individual H. nudus that eat snails were all significant at p &lt; 0.001 with 1 degree of freedom \n(See Table 2 for statistical summary). The three crabs that did not eat either L. scutulata or L. \nvincta could not be tested for feeding preference.  \nCharifson 7 \n \n \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nNo significant difference in crab feeding rate (snails consumed/hour) was found (F2, 21 = \n2.52, p = 0.104) among individual H. nudus that fed on snails during the course of the \nconsumption experiment (Figure 5). Fe2  ate snails at a rate of 0.59±0.53 snails/hour (variance is \nstandard deviation), Ma1 feeding rate was 0.24±0.31 snails/hour, and Ma2 had a feeding rate of \n0.80±0.38 snails/hour. Individuals Fe1, Fe3 and Ma3 did not consume any snails during the \ncourse of the experiment.  \n \nDiscussion: \n \nA few interesting patterns emerged in the morphometric analysis of Hemigrapsus nudus \nand Hemigrapsus orogenensis. The variance in propal height or propal width explained by \ncarapace width was surprisingly high in female H. nudus with R2 values of 0.976 found for \npropal height and 0.927 for propal width. Male H. oregenensis had the greatest variation in chela \nsize parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width \nrespectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently \nlower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In \ngeneral the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \nvalues) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \nmore variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \nefficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \nwhich exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \ncompetition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). \nCharifson 8 \n \nThis is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \nHemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  \nSexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \nHemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \nThe two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \nsuggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \nfunctionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \ndifference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \ndisplacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \ndisplacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \nTo make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \nsympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \n2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \nsympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \nspecies sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \nthe two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \nthe same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \nintertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide \nenough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry. Desiccation tolerance may be \na better trait to test for character displacement in these shore crabs.  \nH. nudus males and females clearly preferred to eat the thinner shelled Lacuna vincta \n(Table 2). During the course of the feeding preference experiment all the crabs that ate snails \nconsumed L. vincta exclusively. However, one Littorina scutuala was eaten by H. nudus when \nCharifson 9 \n \ndetermining consumption rates. The six crabs were chosen because their claws were of \nappropriate size to eat littorines with shell length between 4-6 mm, yet only half of the crabs ate \nthese snails. This could be due to insufficient time to acclimate H. nudus to lab conditions and \npossibly reduced feeding associated with molting. Male snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, were \nshown to cease feeding 3-6 weeks before and 3-4 weeks after molting (O’Halloran and O’Dor \n1988).  \nIt was my original intention to test for sex differences in consumption rates, but this was \nnot possible as I could not collect many crabs of the appropriate claw size for gastropod feeding \nand many of the crabs I did collect did not feed. There were no statistically significant \ndifferences in consumption rates (snails eaten/hour) among the three feeding H. nudus. These \nindividuals had highly variable feeding rates, mostly due to trials in which the crab did not feed. \nSylvia Behrens Yamada and Elizabeth Boulding (1998) found that H. nudus consumed 1.8 \nLittorina. sitkana/individual crab/day. In my study crabs fed on 13.03 Lacuna vincta/individual \ncrab/ day. The greater consumption rate in my study is likely due to the easily breakable shells of \nLa. vincta.  \nThe findings of this study suggest that there is no potential for character displacement of \nchela size in the sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis. This leaves the question of species co-\noccurrence open to other possibilities. H. nudus has a strong preference for La. vincta, but it \nseems as if there have been no studies that show predation on La. vincta in the field. It should be \nnoted that H. nudus and La. vincta usually occupy different portions of the intertidal and may \nhave little contact with each other, unlike the relationship between H. nudus and Li. scutulata. \nThere is some potential for overlap in the winter when La. vincta migrates up shore. Although no \ndifferences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus were found, this might be \nCharifson 10 \n \ndue to logistical issues surrounding the experimental design and little replication. Future studies \nshould include more crabs, the exclusion of non-feeding crabs, and trial periods with longer time \nintervals. Additionally, any subsequent study should utilize multivariate and geometric \nmorphometric methods to quantify claw shape instead of using ratios, as two similar ratios may \nhave different shape.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nI would like to thank Dianna Padilla, Michael LaBarbera, and Kevin Turner for advice \nrelating to the experimental design of this study.

Propal height and propal \nwidth increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. \nSexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but \nthere was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack \nof difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is \nno character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference \nfor the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely \ndue to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \nindividual crabs.  \n \nIntroduction: \n \nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \nnudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \nfiner sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \nconsiderable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \nCharifson 3 \n \nroughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \nmay differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \nBoth species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \nthreat to littorines.  \n \nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \nCharifson 4 \n \nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \n \nStudy System: \n \nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.  Two shore crabs (clade: \nBrachyura: Family Grapsidae), Hemigrapsus oregonensis  and Hemigrapsus nudus were \ncollected in the intertidal adjacent to the Friday Harbor Laboratories dock. These closely related \ncrabs are morphologically similar, but can be distinguished by the presence of purple spots on \nthe cheliped of H. nudus and abundant setae on the pereopods of H. oregonensis (Kozloff 1987). \nLacuna vincta, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were collected at False Bay and \nDead Man Cove. Littorina scutulata, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were \ncollected from the rocky intertidal zone of Fourth of July Beach.  \n \nMaterials and Methods: \nMorphometrics \n \nMale and females of H. oregonensis and H. nudus were measured with digital calipers \n(0.1 mm). Each crab was measured for carapace width, propal height and propal width. Carapace \nwidth was taken at the widest part of the carapace. Propal height was measured at the highest \nvertical distance along the propus. Propal width was measured perpendicular to propal height, \nfrom the left to right sides of the propus. All claw measurements were made on the left cheliped. \nCharifson 5 \n \nIf there was a size disparity between the left and right claws due to regeneration of a lost claw, \nthe crab was excluded from the study. Ratios of carapace width:propal height (CW:PH) and \ncarapace width:propal width (CW:PW) were calculated.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference \n \nThree female (Fe1, Fe2, Fe3) and three male (Ma1, Ma2, Ma3) crabs of H. nudus with \npropal heights between 5-6 mm were placed in small flow-through containers. Five L. scutulata \nand five L. vincta with shell lengths between 4-6 mm were added to each container. The ranges \nof crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the \ncrabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the \nrange of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and \nL. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nThe crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. \nAfter 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption \nrate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \n \nFor the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and \nspecies. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab \nmorphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol \nand Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA \nCharifson 6 \n \nwith factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each \nindividual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail \nconsumption rates by H. nudus.  \n \nResults: \nMorphometrics: \n \nCarapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and \npropal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus. There was \nless variation in the relationship between carapace width and propal height than with propal \nwidth.  Due to non-normality of CW:PH and CW:PW an arcsin transformation was used. A \nsignificant effect for sex was found for both CW:PH (F1, 45 = 125.6, p &lt; 0.001) and CW:PW  (F1, \n45 = 103.81, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between Hemigrapsus species for \nCW:PH (F1, 45 &lt; 0.01, p = 0.983) and CW:PW (F1, 45 = 0.09, p = 0.764). A significant \nsex*species interaction was detected for both CW:PH (F1, 45 4.39, p = 0.042) and CW:PW (F1, 45 \n= 7.19, p = 0.010). Figure 3 and 4 show the means of CW:PH and CW:PW in by sex and species \nrespectively.  \n \nCrab Feeding Preference:  \n \nExpected values for both the number of L. scutulata and L. vincta consumed for the G-\ntest are 0.5 multiplied by the total number of snails consumed by each individual crab. G-tests \nfor individual H. nudus that eat snails were all significant at p &lt; 0.001 with 1 degree of freedom \n(See Table 2 for statistical summary). The three crabs that did not eat either L. scutulata or L. \nvincta could not be tested for feeding preference.  \nCharifson 7 \n \n \nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \n \nNo significant difference in crab feeding rate (snails consumed/hour) was found (F2, 21 = \n2.52, p = 0.104) among individual H. nudus that fed on snails during the course of the \nconsumption experiment (Figure 5). Fe2  ate snails at a rate of 0.59±0.53 snails/hour (variance is \nstandard deviation), Ma1 feeding rate was 0.24±0.31 snails/hour, and Ma2 had a feeding rate of \n0.80±0.38 snails/hour. Individuals Fe1, Fe3 and Ma3 did not consume any snails during the \ncourse of the experiment.  \n \nDiscussion: \n \nA few interesting patterns emerged in the morphometric analysis of Hemigrapsus nudus \nand Hemigrapsus orogenensis. The variance in propal height or propal width explained by \ncarapace width was surprisingly high in female H. nudus with R2 values of 0.976 found for \npropal height and 0.927 for propal width. Male H. oregenensis had the greatest variation in chela \nsize parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width \nrespectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently \nlower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In \ngeneral the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \nvalues) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \nmore variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \nefficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \nwhich exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \ncompetition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). \nCharifson 8 \n \nThis is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \nHemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  \nSexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \nHemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \nThe two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \nsuggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \nfunctionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \ndifference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \ndisplacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \ndisplacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \nTo make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \nsympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \n2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \nsympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \nspecies sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \nthe two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \nthe same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \nintertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide \nenough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry. Desiccation tolerance may be \na better trait to test for character displacement in these shore crabs.  \nH. nudus males and females clearly preferred to eat the thinner shelled Lacuna vincta \n(Table 2). During the course of the feeding preference experiment all the crabs that ate snails \nconsumed L. vincta exclusively. However, one Littorina scutuala was eaten by H. nudus when \nCharifson 9 \n \ndetermining consumption rates. The six crabs were chosen because their claws were of \nappropriate size to eat littorines with shell length between 4-6 mm, yet only half of the crabs ate \nthese snails. This could be due to insufficient time to acclimate H. nudus to lab conditions and \npossibly reduced feeding associated with molting. Male snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, were \nshown to cease feeding 3-6 weeks before and 3-4 weeks after molting (O’Halloran and O’Dor \n1988).  \nIt was my original intention to test for sex differences in consumption rates, but this was \nnot possible as I could not collect many crabs of the appropriate claw size for gastropod feeding \nand many of the crabs I did collect did not feed. There were no statistically significant \ndifferences in consumption rates (snails eaten/hour) among the three feeding H. nudus. These \nindividuals had highly variable feeding rates, mostly due to trials in which the crab did not feed. \nSylvia Behrens Yamada and Elizabeth Boulding (1998) found that H. nudus consumed 1.8 \nLittorina. sitkana/individual crab/day. In my study crabs fed on 13.03 Lacuna vincta/individual \ncrab/ day. The greater consumption rate in my study is likely due to the easily breakable shells of \nLa. vincta.  \nThe findings of this study suggest that there is no potential for character displacement of \nchela size in the sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis. This leaves the question of species co-\noccurrence open to other possibilities. H. nudus has a strong preference for La. vincta, but it \nseems as if there have been no studies that show predation on La. vincta in the field. It should be \nnoted that H. nudus and La. vincta usually occupy different portions of the intertidal and may \nhave little contact with each other, unlike the relationship between H. nudus and Li. scutulata. \nThere is some potential for overlap in the winter when La. vincta migrates up shore. Although no \ndifferences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus were found, this might be \nCharifson 10 \n \ndue to logistical issues surrounding the experimental design and little replication. Future studies \nshould include more crabs, the exclusion of non-feeding crabs, and trial periods with longer time \nintervals. Additionally, any subsequent study should utilize multivariate and geometric \nmorphometric methods to quantify claw shape instead of using ratios, as two similar ratios may \nhave different shape.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nI would like to thank Dianna Padilla, Michael LaBarbera, and Kevin Turner for advice \nrelating to the experimental design of this study.

There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \\nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \\nindividual crabs.  \\n \\nIntroduction: \\n \\nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment.

The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \\nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \\nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \\nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \\nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \\nthreat to littorines.  \\n \\nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \\nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \\ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \\nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \\nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \\nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \\nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \\nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \\namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \\n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \\ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \\nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \\ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \\nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \\nCharifson 4 \\n \\nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \\nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \\nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \\nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \\nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \\n \\nStudy System: \\n \\nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.

    "text": "Image Denoising in OpenCV\n\nTheory\n\nDenoising refers to the process of removing noise from an image, where noise is random variations in brightness or color that can obscure the underlying structure of the image.\nDenoising is essential in various image processing tasks to improve the quality of images and enhance subsequent analysis or visualization.\n\nOpenCV provides four variations of this technique:\n\ncv.fastNlMeansDenoising() - works with a single grayscale images\ncv.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored() - works with a color image.\ncv.fastNlMeansDenoisingMulti() - works with image sequence captured in short period of time (grayscale images)\ncv.fastNlMeansDenoisingColoredMulti() - same as above, but for color images.\n\nFunction Syntax\ndenoised = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(src, None, h=10, templateWindowSize=7, searchWindowSize=21)\n\nsrc: Imput image- should be an 8-bit or 16-bit single channel image\nNone: This parameter is a placeholder for the output denoised image. Since we want to obtain the denoised image as the output, we pass None, and the function will allocate memory for the output automatically.\nh: Parameter regulating filter strength. A larger h value leads to stronger denoising. Typically, h should be between 5 and 20. (10 is ok)\nA larger h value will result in stronger filtering, which means more noise reduction but also more potential blurring of edges and details in the image. Conversely, a smaller h value will result in weaker filtering, preserving more details but potentially leaving more noise in the image.\ntemplateWindowSize: size in pixels of the window used to compute the weighted average for a given pixel. It should be an odd value, typically in the range of 3 to 21. (recommended 7)\nsearchWindowSize: Size in pixels of the window used to search for similar patches. It should be an odd value, typically larger than templateWindowSize (recommended 21)\n\nPurpose of each parameter\n\nh: Controls the amount of denoising. Higher values of “h” will result in stronger denoising\ntemplateWindowSize: Determines the size of the pixel neighborhood used to compute the weighted average for denoising. Larger values will result in smoother output but may remove finer details.\nsearchWindowSize: Determines the size of the neighborhood to search for similar patches. Larger values will consider a larger region for similarity, which may increase computational cost but can provide better denoising.",

It was found that the two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, suggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are functionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). Additionally, the consumption rates of H. nudus for Littorina sitkana and Lacuna vincta were found to be 1.8 and 13.03/individual crab/day respectively, and there was no potential for character displacement of chela size in the sympatric species. There were also no differences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus. [Page no. 8], [Page no. 10], [Page no. 14].\nThe paper discussed the morphometrics and consumption rates of Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Hemigrapsus nudus, two closely related crabs that can be distinguished by external features. Male and female crabs were measured with digital calipers for carapace width, propal height and propal width [Page no. 5]. Consumption rates of 3 female (Fe1 to Fe3) and 3 male (Ma1 to Ma3) crabs were also calculated [Page no. 21].

It also examines claw morphology, prey size selection, and foraging efficiency in generalist and specialist shell-breaking crabs. The study received financial support from various organizations and was conducted at Friday Harbor Laboratories with permission to collect organisms\nThe paper acknowledges the support and facilities provided by Friday Harbor Laboratories, The Libbie Hyman Scholarship, Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, and the Stony Brook Department of Ecology and Evolution.

It also investigates the potential for character displacement in chela size between the two species. (Page 2)\nThe paper investigates the relationship between propus size and snail predation in Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. The study uses standardized major axis regression to analyze the morphometric parameters of the crabs. The researchers also analyze prey selection by H. nudus using G-tests and one-way ANOVA. The results show that carapace width is a good predictor of propal height and width in both male and female crabs of both species. There is sexual dimorphism in chela size, but no detectable difference in chela size between the two species. The study suggests that there is no potential for character displacement in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis.\n\n\n\nComparing results for initial questions across the three tools.\n\n\nSource: experiments"
