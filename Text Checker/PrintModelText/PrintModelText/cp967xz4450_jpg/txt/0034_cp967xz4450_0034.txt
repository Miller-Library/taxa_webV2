FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Comparison of relative shell heights for the four species tested.
The shells are divided into low( C limatula), middle( C. pelte, C. digitelis)
and high(A mitra) relative heights.
Figure 2. A. Diegram indiceting varieble shell thickness in limpet shells.
The cross-section shows that the margins and apex are thickened relative
to the muscle scar. B. Diagram of the underside of a limpet shell.
IIlustrating the horseshoe-shape of the muscle scar.
Figure 3. A. (From MacClintock, 1967). Diegram showing the orientation
of sheil lagers in e limpet shell. The leger labelled "m" is the
myostracum(muscle scar lager). B. Cross-section of the shell at the level
of the muscle scar, showing that the myostrecum originates on the inner
surface of the shell where the "scar“ appeers. A crab-like force would
produce tension at the inner surface(the myostracum). P-Prisms.
CL-Crossed-lamellar.
Figure 4. Bending caused by crab-like forces at the muscle scar. The
calcium carbonate shell would tend to frecture first along the inner
surface since the shell is weaker in tension than compression.
Figure 5. Photograph of limpets used in studg, showing relative height
ditferences. From left to right: C limatule, C. digitelis, A. mitre, C pelte
Figure 6. Limpet shell crusher used to frecture shells. A. Side view.
showing a loaded shell situated between two metal plates. The plates are
sttsched to the large wood blocks. B: Front view. The wood block at the
left provides a substrete for the shell, preventing the sheil from slipping
to the lett. Theright side of the device is wedged against some bject to
prevent sliding to the right. C. Side view, showing two aluminum breces
attached to the upper block. The breces prevent the upper block from
sliding over the shell(to the left or right).
